## Statistics Calculator: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Statistics Calculator app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Ikeh Leonard. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (like saved calculations, etc.) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data, deleting the saved calculations from the app or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Ikeh Leonard.
Lagos, Nigeria.
